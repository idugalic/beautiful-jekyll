Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.

The main reasons why I am contributing to open source are to:
 - Improve existing skills
 - Meet people who are interested in similar things
 - Find mentors and teach others
 - Build public artifacts that help me grow a reputation (and a career)
