Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.

The main reasons why I am contributing to open source are to:
 - Improve existing skills
 - Meet people who are interested in similar things
 - Find mentors and teach others
 - Build public artifacts that help me grow a reputation (and a career)
 
This projects are demonstrating use of:
 - Object Oriented Programming and Design concepts
 - Functional and Reactive Programming and Design concepts

with programming languages:
 - Java
 - Kotlin
 - TypeScript

and frameworks:
 - Spring
 - Axonframework
 - Angular

by applying:
 - Monolithic modular architectural style
 - Microservices architectural style
